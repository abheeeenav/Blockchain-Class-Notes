# Blockchain-Class-Notes

Contains my notes from Blockchain Lectures.

## Lecture 1 - 5th August
Blockchain is chain of blocks, each block has set of transactions, based on these transactions it creates a hash code.\
These set of blocks have a unique hashcode associated to details of transactions. Combining these blocks make a node.\
All cryptos are one possible application of blockchain.\
Zero block is called the Genesis Block. (Zero Block: The first block of Blockchain)\

#### Features of Distributed Ledger (DLT)
- Programmable i.e Smart Contracts
- Secure
- Anonymous
- Unanimous
