# Blockchain-Class-Notes

Contains my notes from Blockchain Lectures.

## Lecture 1 - 5th August
Blockchain is chain of blocks, each block has set of transactions, based on these transactions it creates a hash code.\
These set of blocks have a unique hashcode associated to details of transactions. Combining these blocks make a node.\
All cryptos are one possible application of blockchain.\
Zero block is called the Genesis Block. (Zero Block: The first block of Blockchain)\


#### Features of Blockchain
- System of recording information
- Difficult/Impossible to change, hack or cheat
- Fully decentralized p2p data storage spread across all particiapnts that are reffered as nodes.

#### Features of Distributed Ledger (DLT)
- Programmable i.e Smart Contracts
- Secure
- Anonymous
- Unanimous
- Distributed
- Immutable
- TimeStamped



## Lecture 2 - 6th August
Blockchain - Distributed ledger for maintaining a permanent and secure ledger managed by p2p network.\

#### Blockchain Internals
Miner Node
- Extremely powerful hardware
- Can take multiple transactions, create a hash that meets blockchain's difficulty level
- somebody takes group of transactions and create a valid hash for it.
- Once such block is accpeted in blockchain, Miner gets his fees.


#### Types of Blockchain
Public Blockchain
- Anyone can be a node in public network and submit transactions
- Example: $BTC, $ETH

Private Blockchain
- use blockchain according to your business logic
- private in scope and limited to defined users.
- Example: Ethereum, Polygon

Permisionless Blockchain
- Anyone can process transactions

Permissioned Blockchain
- Only approved nodes(also referred as users) can process transaction
